# Line 1: print(random.randint(5, 20))
#The smallest number that could have been seen is 5, while the largest would be 20.

# Line 2: print(random.randrange(3, 10, 2))
# The smallest number that could be seen is 3, while the largest largest was 9. This could not have produced a four
# as it was only stepping up in twos, meaning it would only be the odd numbers.

# Line 3: print(random.uniform(2.5, 5.5))
# The smallest number that could have been seen is 2.5, the largest would presumably be 5.5
